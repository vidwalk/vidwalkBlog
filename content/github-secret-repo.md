Title: Github Secret Repository
Date: 2020-08-18
Slug: github-secret-repo
Summary: I will share a secret I randomly found while using Github.
tldr: If you use your username when you create a repository, you will be able to use the readme.md to create a longer description on your Github Profile.

I was looking into hosting this page on Github Pages as a demo run for it. While inputting the name, there I found a surprise.

I created this repository with a readme.md file as instructed, put some text in and voila:

From here on, it is easy to plug in links towards website, projects or products you work on.

There isn't much to share other than this. It is a nice feature to find out by surprise.
