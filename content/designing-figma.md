Summary: Examples of what I have done with Figma
tldr: I made some design for friends or my own projects that I would like to share. Putting forth some of my work.

The first design I'm going to show is for my bachelor thesis. Me and my team plan to do a landing page from where the application can be downloaded. I thought about the color pallete, the theme of the project and ended up with this on the mobile version:

The target audience for this app would be Supply Chain Engineers and people looking into expanding into untapped markets. I tried to do as much as I can with the space I had while also letting the design breathe. In the desktop version, I added one more detail while also maintaining space between elements.

The visual representation shows the flow of international trade to give more context to the page. Make it possible to the user that he knows as much of the substance as possible. One big problem I had was adjusting the title of the page and the picture so they both get along in the design. After some trial and error, I figured out that the best would be to keep the title on one page and make the border around the image smaller.

Another design I made, mostly for fun, was for a friend of mine that is very stylish. I thought it would be fun to make him a website that I would later on expand on. I ended up with this:

I keep the colors in between black, white, burgundy and some brown from the photo. These are the colors he wears most of the time. The biggest problem I had with the page where the buttons. It took me a while to make them work with the design because I was getting the right contrast and the buttons just didn't go in with the shape they had. What I did was to put white filling, make the borders burgundy and let the text be as easy to read as possible.

These are some examples of some designs I made and I will show more of them with time as inspiration and a way to share my experience.
