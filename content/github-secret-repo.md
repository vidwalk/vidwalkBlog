Title: Github Secret Repository
Date: 2020-08-18
Slug: github-secret-repo
Summary: I will share a secret I randomly found while using Github.
tldr: If you use your username when you create a repository, you will be able to use the readme.md to create a longer description on your Github Profile.

I was looking into hosting this page on Github Pages as a demo run and while I was typing in I got a surprise.

I created this repository with a readme.md file as instructed, put some text in and voila:

![Github Secret Repo](https://vidwalk.github.io/vidwalkBlog/images/readme-profile.png "Github Secret Repo")

From here on, it is easy to plug in links towards website, projects or products you work on.

There isn't much to share other than this. It is a nice feature to find out by surprise.
